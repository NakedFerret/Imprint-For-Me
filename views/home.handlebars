    <h3> What is this? </h3>
    <p> Imprint for me is a bookkeeper for digital signatures. Signing a message with a digital signature verifies: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> The identity of the author </li>
        <li> The integrity of the message </li>
        <li> The authenticity of the message (more or less)  </li>
      </ul>
    <p> Additionally, by signing the message here, we can verify the time the message was created </p>
    <h3> How is that useful? </h3>
	  <p> Giving someone a signed message is practically irrevocable proof you wrote/said something. Your imagination is the limit in this application but so far I've thought of  </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Set terms of a bet </li>
        <li> Make a pseudo-contract when selling/buying privately </li>
        <li> Foretell the future </li>
      </ul>
    <h3> Why not just take a screenshot of an email/text? </h3>
	  <p> These are much harder to spoof </p>
    <h3> How do we know the signed message is not fake? </h3>
	  <p> There's a page to verify messages below </p>
