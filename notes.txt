- I want to limit the size of messages so that message and signature can
be sent in one or two text messages
- Text messages sent in latin languages have a limit of 160 chars, or 153
if sending a text that is longer than that (because it will be split up into
multiple text messages). 
- See https://www.plivo.com/faq/sms/what-is-the-character-limit-for-sms-text-messages/
- Text messages sent in languages that need UTF8 are limited to 70/67 chars
- Originally considered using RSA for digital signature. The problem is that 
RSA signatures are huge! A 2048 bit key will produce 396 char pgp signatures!
- Using the 256 NIST ECC preset produces pgp signatures that are 136 chars long 
instead that's better but lets see if we can improve it without sacrificing
security
- The node library eccrypto is a nice wrapper for secp256k1. It's used in bitcoin.
Signatures are 71 bytes long
- To transmit the signature we should convert it to ascii text to reduce the likelyhood
of a user's communication channel modifying the byte sequence (Think text messages
messing with fonts/emojis)
- We can encode the signature in hex! But that's really inefficient. It would take 
140 chars. Leaves enough room in a text message but we can do better!
- With base64 encoding the signature can be represented in 96 chars! Woo so much space!
- Considering settling on using gpg npm package and 256 NIST ECC algorithms for signatures
- However...the node gpg package only calls gpg from the command line, and the ECC algorigthms
are in gpg2. Need to do a bit of wrangling there
- We could use NaCl. There's a port of it in node
- NaCl uses 64 bit private keys to sign using the ed25519 algorithms/curve. The signature
also turns out to be 64 bytes or 88 base64 chars. Woo!
- Stack: nginx -> node -> postgresql. Nginx will serve static assets. Node will serve html and power API
- Manage environment variables with .dotenv. Hash assets with express-asset-versions so we can cache 
old asset versions
- Table structures:
CREATE TABLE users(
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  public_key bytea UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  public_key_id CHAR(8) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE declarations(
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  message VARCHAR(140) NOT NULL,
  signature bytea UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (id)
);

- When configuring knex to connect over localhost, had to update user password and
provide as environment variable. Instead could use unix and would use OS to auth
user
- Might use the $20 https://www.vultr.com/pricing/ VPS. 60 GB space, 4GB memory, 
3 TB bandwidth, availability to add more space on demand and good performance:
