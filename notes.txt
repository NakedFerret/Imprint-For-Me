- I want to limit the size of messages so that message and signature can
be sent in one or two text messages
- Text messages sent in latin languages have a limit of 160 chars, or 153
if sending a text that is longer than that (because it will be split up into
multiple text messages). 
- See https://www.plivo.com/faq/sms/what-is-the-character-limit-for-sms-text-messages/
- Text messages sent in languages that need UTF8 are limited to 70/67 chars
- Originally considered using RSA for digital signature. The problem is that 
RSA signatures are huge! A 2048 bit key will produce 396 char signatures!
- Using 256 bit ECC key produces digital signature that is 136 chars long 
instead that's better but lets see if we can improve it without sacrificing
security
